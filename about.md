`hello world`

My name is Martin.
I believe that only a more conscious, self-aware life can change the world. Art and science are the way.
The internet is only as good as we make it, so let's start building it.

By day, I am an energy analyst at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), interested in all aspects of renewable energy systems. Check out my research [here](/research/). Views are my own.

When time allows it, I like to [make music](/music/), [manipulate analogue photos with ink](/scratch/), and work with software. The [articles](/articles/) section is a mixture of short and not so short typed-up thoughts.
