`hello world`

Martin here.


By day, I am an associate at [50Hertz](https://www.50hertz.com/en/){:target="blank"}, a transmission system operator based in Berlin. There I am working on energy scenarios in the context of long-term electricity grid planning. Prior to this, I wrote my PhD dissertation on energy system modelling. You can learn more about my research [here](/research/). I am interested in all aspects of energy systems, in particular solar energy and how to get to net-zero emissions. Energy is vital to our modern life; providing it securely and reliably is imperative. 

Besides that, I try to spend my life as aware and creative as possible.
I enjoy [electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/0_k/){:target="blank"}, manipulate [analogue photos with ink](/scratch/), and engage with [software](https://github.com/0-k){:target="blank"}.

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"}, a free and open source static site generator. The internet is only as good as we make it, so let's start building it! We can communicate and exchange ideas in ways that were totally inaccessible for most generations before us. This will change everything.
