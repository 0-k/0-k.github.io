`hello world`

Martin here.


I am interested in all aspects of energy systems, in particular solar energy and how to get to net-zero emissions. Energy is vital to our modern life; providing it securely and reliably is imperative. You can learn more about my research [here](/research/).

I try to spend my life as aware and creative as possible.
I enjoy [electronic music](/music/), manipulate [analogue photos with ink](/scratch/), and engage with [software](/vision/).

By day, I am an energy market analyst and modeler working at [Wattsight](https://www.wattsight.com/){:target="blank"}. I live and work in Berlin.

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"}, a free and open source static site generator. The internet is only as good as we make it, so let's start building it! Yo, just think about the odds that you are reading this. We can communicate and exchange ideas in ways that were totally inaccessible for most generations before us. This will change everything.
