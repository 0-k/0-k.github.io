`hello world`

Martin here.


—

By day, I am an energy systems modeler interested in all aspects of net-zero emission energy systems, in particular solar energy. Check out my research [here](/research/).

By night, I like to make [machine music](/music/), manipulate [analogue photos with ink](/scratch/), and work with software, for example with [computer vision algorithms](/vision/).

I believe that only a more conscious, self-aware life can change the world. Art and science are the way!
