`hello world`

Martin here.


—

By day, I am an energy market analyst and modeler at [Wattsight](https://www.wattsight.com/){:target="_blank"} interested in all aspects of energy systems, in particular solar energy and how to get to net-zero emissions. You can check out the research I did in the last years [here](/research/).

I try to spend my life as aware and creative as possible. 
If I'm not too busy, I work on [electronic music](/music/), manipulate [analogue photos with ink](/scratch/), and engage with software, for example [this](/vision/). 

I live and work in Berlin.

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, a free and open source static site generator. The internet is only as good as we make it, so let's start building it! Yo, just think about the odds that you are reading this. We can communicate and exchange ideas in ways that were totally inaccessible for most generations before us. This will change everything.
