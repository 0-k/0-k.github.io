`hello world`

My name is Martin. I am fascinated by the world wide web, AI, music, art, space and big history. 

By day, I am an energy analyst at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), interested in all aspects of renewable energy systems. Check out my research [here](/research/).

When time allows it, I like to [make music](/music/), [manipulate analogue photos with ink](/scratch/), and work with software.
