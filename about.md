`hello world`

Martin here.

By day, I am an energy market analyst and modeler interested in all aspects of energy systems, in particular solar energy and how to get to net-zero emissions. You can check out the research I did in the last years [here](/research/).

I try to spend my life as conscious, self-aware and creative as possible. 
If I'm not too busy, I work on [electronic music](/music/), manipulate [analogue photos with ink](/scratch/), and engage with software, for example [this](/vision/).
