`hello world`

My name is Martin. I am fascinated by the world wide web, AI, music, art, space and big history. Here you find an excerpt from my most recent projects.

At day, I am an energy analyst at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), interested in all aspects of renewable energy systems. Check out my research [here](/research/).

When time allows it, I like to make music and manipulate analogue photos with ink.
