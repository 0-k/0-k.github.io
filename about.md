# Hello World! Thanks for visiting my site! 

By day, I am an associate at [50Hertz](https://www.50hertz.com/en/){:target="blank"}, a transmission system operator based in Berlin, where I am working on energy scenarios for long-term electricity grid planning. Before this, I wrote my PhD dissertation on energy system modeling. You can learn more about my research [here](/research/). I am interested in all aspects of energy systems, particularly solar energy, and how to get to net-zero emissions. Energy is vital to our modern life; providing it securely and reliably is imperative.

> This is me in Bologna, Italy. These large towers were build in medival times to, guess what, impress people. Still works for me. 


I try to spend my life as aware and creative as possible. I enjoy [electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/0_k/){:target="blank"}, manipulating [analog photos with ink](/scratch/), and engaging with [software](https://github.com/0-k){:target="blank"}.

[Contact me](/contact) if you find the content of this site interesting or want to learn more. You can also find me on other sites:

We can communicate and exchange ideas in ways that were inaccessible for most generations before us. This will change everything.
