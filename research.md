I just submitted my PhD dissertation on agent-based modeling of electricity markets, trying to understand and model what the transition towards net-zero emission energy systems can look like. What fascinates me most is solar energy. For the last 10+ years I have read everything I could find on the subject.

In that time, PV costs decreased by more than 90%.
We are not far from the point that solar energy is so cheap that abundant clean energy for all can become a reality.

Specifically, I have researched the investment dynamics of solar photovoltaics (PV), and how to shape and regulate energy markets with very high shares of renewables. I focus on PV-battery systems and the techno-economic assessment of households which not only consume but also produce electricity (so-called prosumers). The work combines insights from computer science, engineering, economics and psychology.
