Currently, I am writing my PhD dissertation on agent-based modeling of electricity markets. 
Basically, we try to understand and model what the transition towards clean energy can look like.
The work is located in the department of [Energy Systems Analysis](https://www.dlr.de/tt/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-2904/4394_read-6500/){:target="_blank"} at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). 

I am researching the investment dynamics of renewable energy sources (RES), in particular decentralized sources like solar photovoltaics (PV), and how to shape and regulate energy markets with very high shares of RES. Special attention is paid to PV battery systems and the techno-economic assessment of households which not only consume but also produce electricity (so-called prosumers). The work combines insights from computer science, engineering, economics and psychology.
