<h3 id="10-against-all-logic---now-u-got-me-hooked"><b>10. Against All Logic - Now U Got Me Hooked</b></h3>

<p><br />
That podcast was something else — enigmatically called Against All Logic #279, it never failed to propell me forward and calm me down into a flow state.
“Against All Logic“, it turned out, is the club alias of Nicolas Jaar under which he recently released an album called “2012-2017”. The songs are mix-downs of live versions Jaar played over time. “Now U Got Me Hooked” is luckily part of that album.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="9-kettenkarussell---maybe"><b>9. Kettenkarussell - Maybe</b></h3>
<p>It had to be an Youtube underground hit. First, the algorithms pushed it into my playlists, later I voluntarily returned on my own. At the time of writing, the track has already more than 3 million plays, quite a number for a channel for „lofi house“ aficionados. But the channel belongs to “Slav“, who also featured “DJ Boring - Winona“, and the record itself is signed by the notorious “Giegling“ label.

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="8-dj-koze---pick-up"><b>8. DJ Koze - Pick Up</b></h3>
<p>I am a simple man. When I hear a groove that never resolves and tickles that sweet sweet French house nerve like “Music Sounds Better With You“ or “One More Time“, I hit buy, no question. Even more so when this is so crackingly produced by one of the Master’s himself - DJ Koze. The video is a hilarious gem too.

<h3 id="7-dj-existential-crisis---raised-by-wolves"><b>7. DJ Existential Crisis - Raised By Wolves</b></h3>
<p>A basement full of smoke and flashing lights. The soundsystem banging. People cheering. DJ Existential Crisis is another alias of master producer Paul Woolford / Special Request. No wonder. I got hooked by that baseline at first listen. After all we’ve been through﻿.

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="6-djrum---blue-violet"><b>6. DJRum - Blue Violet</b></h3>
<p>Djrum’s tracks are complex, fast, physical, yet often full of strangely attracting tenderness. Blue Violet is no exception. I adore the level of detail in all his productions.

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="5-breach---turtle-dance"><b>5. Breach - Turtle Dance</b></h3>
<p>A perfect combination of playfulness and “out there.“ My favorite moment is around the 4 minute mark - would fit perfectly to an outdoor festival, late-night, Croatian coast.
<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="4-bicep---opal-four-tet-remix"><b>4. Bicep - Opal (Four Tet Remix)</b></h3>
<p>Love the album, love the remix. The combination of groove and feels has made this a go to track for me during the whole year. The strings in the beginning started to be comfort zone. Really hard to get this in electronic music.
<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="3-skee-mask---flyby-vfr"><b>3. Skee Mask - Flyby Vfr</b></h3>
<p>Drums like Floating Points. Insane breaks. And the feels. Nothing to add here.
<br /></p>
<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WrxXObHUyVg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="2-overmono---daisy-chain"><b>2. Overmono - Daisy Chain</b></h3>
<p>“Bass music” is seldomly gentle, but this track, albeit quite rough and low, has such a sweet melancholy to it. Favorite moment: Past minute 5, when the clicks collaps and the heaviness of the beat sets in again. Tessela’s characteristic vocal chops are the icing on the cake.
<br /></p>
<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dTFO5_ERBq0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="1-aleksandir---yamaha"><b>1. Aleksandir - Yamaha</b></h3>
<p>Here too, the Youtube algorithm had flooded the track into my feeds. And boy was I happy. I didn’t know Aleksandir, nor the label Tessellate before, but this track has every right to &gt;3 million clicks by now. The synth progression and the crispness of the production made this my favorite of 2018. A track whose rightful success is the perfect embodiment of the potential of our times.<br />
