Resident Advisor and other electronic music outlets stopped to release storted lists because, as they say, they cannot bring the tracks in a definite order. But that is exactly what I expect from music critiques - guidance and opinion in times of abundance. So I created my own completely subjective top 10 of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-against-all-logic---now-u-got-me-hooked&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Against All Logic - Now U Got Me Hooked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That podcast was something else — enigmatically called Against All Logic #279, it never failed to propell me forward and calm me down into a flow state.
“Against All Logic“, it turned out, is the club alias of Nicolas Jaar under which he recently released an album called “2012-2017”. The songs are mix-downs of live versions Jaar played over time. “Now U Got Me Hooked” is luckily part of that album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-kettenkarussell---maybe&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Kettenkarussell - Maybe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had to be an Youtube underground hit. First, the algorithms pushed it into my playlists, later I voluntarily returned on my own. At the time of writing, the track has already more than 3 million plays, quite a number for a channel for „lofi house“ aficionados. But the channel belongs to “Slav“, who also featured “DJ Boring - Winona“, and the record itself is signed by the notorious “Giegling“ label. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-dj-koze---pick-up&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. DJ Koze - Pick Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a simple man. When I hear a groove that never resolves and tickles that sweet sweet French house nerve like “Music Sounds Better With You“ or “One More Time“, I hit buy, no question. Even more so when this is so crackingly produced by one of the Master’s himself - DJ Koze. The video is a hilarious gem too.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-dj-existential-crisis---raised-by-wolves&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. DJ Existential Crisis - Raised By Wolves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basement full of smoke and flashing lights. The soundsystem banging. People cheering. DJ Existential Crisis is another alias of master producer Paul Woolford / Special Request. No wonder. I got hooked by that baseline at first listen. After all we’ve been through﻿. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UHRPF1g2Vfg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-djrum---blue-violet&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. DJRum - Blue Violet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Djrum’s tracks are complex, fast, physical, yet often full of strangely attracting tenderness. Blue Violet is no exception. I adore the level of detail in all his productions.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-breach---turtle-dance&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Breach - Turtle Dance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perfect combination of playfulness and “out there.“ My favorite moment is around the 4 minute mark - would fit perfectly to an outdoor festival, late-night, Croatian coast.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B39kqzrXp1E&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-bicep---opal-four-tet-remix&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Bicep - Opal (Four Tet Remix)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love the album, love the remix. The combination of groove and feels has made this a go to track for me during the whole year. The strings in the beginning started to be comfort zone. Really hard to get this in electronic music.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XTw-NrqKigs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-skee-mask---flyby-vfr&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Skee Mask - Flyby Vfr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drums like Floating Points. Insane breaks. And the feels. Nothing to add here.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WrxXObHUyVg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-overmono---daisy-chain&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Overmono - Daisy Chain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bass music” is seldomly gentle, but this track, albeit quite rough and low, has such a sweet melancholy to it. Favorite moment: Past minute 5, when the clicks collaps and the heaviness of the beat sets in again. Tessela’s characteristic vocal chops are the icing on the cake.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dTFO5_ERBq0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-aleksandir---yamaha&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Aleksandir - Yamaha&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here too, the Youtube algorithm had flooded the track into my feeds. And boy was I happy. I didn’t know Aleksandir, nor the label Tessellate before, but this track has every right to &amp;gt;3 million clicks by now. The synth progression and the crispness of the production made this my favorite of 2018. A track whose rightful success is the perfect embodiment of the potential of our times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
