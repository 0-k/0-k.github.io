The first priority for governments and society at large is to prepare for some degree of global climate change and to avoid dangerous warming at all costs - whether by reducing emissions to limit the risk or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the real sense.
Governments are engaged in the fight against climate change and are in a strong position to act.

A more nuanced understanding of this issue, as well as implications for policies, is needed to develop an optimal climate policy framework and implement an emissions based framework. To help achieve such a framework, we must consider a multitude of policies that can reduce fossil fuel use such as energy efficiency, climate adaptation, energy efficiency targets and carbon capture and storage technologies

As a result of the high cost and limited availability of effective mitigation measures that reduce global greenhouse gas emissions under current economic models, governments and the public now take the risk-reward approach by seeking investment in emissions reduction projects.

These types of investments were not available to investors, because energy efficiency and climate adaptation projects would have failed because of their lack of financial viability, as they did not have public financing or sufficient timeframes to implement.

What will stop climate change? Climate change is complex. The key factors are:

* The natural and human activities that cause climate change,
* How fast we reduce greenhouse gases,
* The rate at which these gases are released and their impact on global and local climate,
* The extent to which CO2 is released as emissions,
* The magnitude and severity of temperature and cloud changes associated with GHG emissions, and
* The speed of climate changes,
* Where climate models allow, how much of these changes can be attributed to GHGs, and
* An increasing level of certainty for the rate of GHG emissions.

There are practical limits in the ability of mankind, by itself and in combination, to curb climate change; however, there is strong evidence of the power of individuals and institutions to affect the way we live and behave.

There are several important steps. In 2009, the World Bank launched the Climate Change for All Act and initiated actions aiming to make financial contribution to low-carbon energy. With the first $300 million pledged, the bank announced a pilot for a carbon tax that would replace many forms of oil subsidies with a fee on carbon emissions. In 2011, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proposed a series of carbon taxes to cover 50 to 60% of energy-related emissions through 2020. These policies will be rolled out as part of the Paris Agreement in Paris in December 2015.

There are many ways in which we can stop our emissions. In the short term, there are options. Many governments and non state actors have adopted actionable policy in this regard, and in many countries these actions are being implemented.

For example, in some countries including China, a cap-and-trade system and a carbon price have been introduced to slow the increase in emissions that currently results from a rapidly growing economy that also requires increasing levels of physical capital and employment. In the most prosperous nations of Asia, the adoption of carbon prices and emissions trading (ETS), where energy is produced for renewable energy and traded for capital goods, has reduced energy consumption and the climate-damaging carbon emissions of industrial users in many economically successful developing countries.

There are three distinct approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation - an emissions intensity approach and a mitigation approach. The former is focused on the gradual introduction of CO2 restrictions and emissions reductions - by the year 2100, some 40% of industrial emissions to CO2 would have been cut by 2080 - through a combination of measures including CO2 limits on emissions from coal, oil and gas, biofuels, the development and implementation of smart grid technology, the construction of new power plants, etc. The latter approach is focused on the gradual introduction of CO2 restrictions. These are achieved through measures such as building more efficient and cleaner energy systems, switching to clean sources of power or reducing CO2 emissions from sources such as fossil fuels and deforestation.

The key issue for the decision-makers of climate change mitigation is not as much "how can we stop the climate change", as how to tackle it at the earliest possible time. It is also not to be confused with the process currently underway regarding the reduction of industrial emissions, to which will be compared these developments: How to reduce CO 2 emissions at a rate that will help to mitigate their effect, to minimize their role in the continuing climate change, and to slow such a process down.

Many factors, including how efficient and how resilient are individual sectors to climate change, as well as individual governments, the UNEP and international donors, are critical in how we will tackle the climate change that is already causing damage. A number of factors have proved difficult to quantify or fully understand, while many more questions need to be further studied before the mitigation strategies of the future will include the assessment of greenhouse gas effect and the development of more comprehensive approaches.

One of the key processes we are now undergoing, based on the analysis and projections released by the international community, is the decarbonization of industrial systems. Carbon sequestration is the decarbonization of industrial systems of CO2 emissions.

Governments in the developed world, including Great Britain, have led the global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including through significant increases in energy efficiency and conservation; improved infrastructure and management of climate change risks; the development of cost-effective and accessible emissions trading systems; and the expansion of market-based systems of financial support for adaptation.

The EU's Kyoto Protocol, in which Kyoto-1 will require the cut-down of methane, was implemented with much fanfare by the EU government in 2007, and implemented to remarkable levels of success, largely on the advice of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, particularly in the developing world.

Developing and emerging economies have been increasingly committed to low-carbon electricity and energy markets and have undertaken substantial initiatives related to emissions and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, including climate financing and the "cap-and-trade" technology.

Other major international organizations, most notably the UN Environment Programme and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization — along with national governments, including the European Union — have made major moves towards emission reductions in the United States (United States emissions levels fell significantly over the past 20 years, including significant steps to tackle oil-fueled power plant emissions).

The answer may lie in a combination of both measures: more aggressive public campaigns as well as continued low emissions reduction and development of high-technology, low-emission sources of clean energy.

Governments and their central banks may have the ability to take the risk of climate change. However, the risk is high that if a large number of countries do not reduce their energy and GHG use, these countries will face risks to their financial health and their prospects for growth.

If, as is probable, global economic growth is cut markedly (by 15% from 2020 onwards), it seems likely that the world will come to a stage where economic growth will be constrained and social welfare might suffer. It will likely entail substantial social and health risks if emissions continue at their current level.

We are now at a critical juncture in human history, if we are to see an additional 0.7°C by late 2030 or by the turn of the century, at least as a consequence of the continued human influence on climate over the intervening period.

In order to prevent catastrophic climate change, countries need to implement emissions reductions targets that capture climate mitigation and adaptation options, but without resorting to drastic and costly actions as may now be required.

This requires that mitigation options, while effective, are not a large part of mitigation plans, in light of the rapid transition to a new industrial economy from an unhampered and less intensive industrial economy, which in turn must adapt to rising environmental issues such as sea level rise and heatwaves. The aim is to focus on reducing the number of CO2 emissions in the economy by changing to the non-carbon energy sources of choice.

This is not a trivial task. There are many technical obstacles. The biggest is how to assess and implement the changes for each market. Some models do not allow for this.
It is not yet possible to create a comprehensive economic model or even a framework that provides a precise estimate for each model, although an assessment of each of these factors can provide much of a global picture. A recent assessment project by the ERC in 2015 based on market model results did identify some challenges associated with implementation of carbon markets and climate mitigation.

Since humans are at the heart of climate change, many approaches suggest that some forms of action may be more likely to prevent future warming, such as limiting carbon dioxide emissions of the fossil fuel industries to keep global warming below the 2°C limit. The two most prominent approaches are:

The Carbon Tax and a tax on gas prices which would require polluters to produce energy at a cost comparable to alternative sources. The latter approach was considered in 2009 by the United States government.

Another alternative, that could have been applied to future CO2 reductions, involves introducing a carbon fee to the fuel market and requiring companies who are not willing to produce energy with less CO2 to sell lower-emitting emissions to society at large, i.e. to the government.

These alternative measures require significant public support and could be difficult to implement on a large scale.

In the past, the most prominent approaches were targeted at low emissions (such as the Global Carbon Price) or at industrial emissions (such as the price of cars). However, new technologies are now beginning to provide direct price regulation of coal mining and oil production.

A recent report from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund has suggested that this approach could be much more costly than the direct price measure proposed for the price of cars.

 There is a simple way of addressing climate change without destroying the environment, such as by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

In summary: reduce emission of greenhouse gases by at least 80 percent on current emissions levels; reduce by at least 90 percent on emissions by 2030 or more; and substantially reduce future emissions.

The key component of a comprehensive strategy is to achieve high-impact action to reduce emissions that will cause widespread public health implications, social hardship, economic damages, and other impacts. This includes adaptation measures, like adaptation to climate change, but also includes ways to protect livelihoods and communities from the impacts that climate change will have, including adaptation options.

To achieve high-impact action to reduce emissions that will cause widespread public health consequences, adaptation measures, including mitigation, have to be a key component of any new emissions regulation strategy (in this case, new emissions limits).

The global carbon budget (greenhouse gas emissions at global production level, or GPP) for a society with a population of 25% of the world's average means of production is estimated to be $15 trillion.

1 - Global emissions are high.

2 - The world is facing an immense range of impacts that are likely to produce profound challenges.

3 - A world-leading global initiative is required - from all levels of government to the poorest and most vulnerable communities - to deal with those threats.

4 - We will have to adapt to the world changing climate and to extreme weather. We can adapt to the changing nature of our relationship with the natural environment, to more abundant sources of energy, to the impacts of technological advances and to our response to climate-change and energy security. We must make the necessary investments in mitigation.

5 - There is no "win-win" situation - there is simply the opportunity to lead the way as a country, as an economy and, importantly, as a global society. That is why some are calling for swift global action on warming. This is more than a debate about which is the right course of action, rather about a question of how to achieve our goals collectively, with a view to achieving universal climate and energy security, and addressing all problems and risks.

Here are some key recommendations drawn from the climate transition strategy:

Reduce carbon dioxide emissions; the majority of which have been coming from human sources. Emissions can be cut further if it is more expensive to heat homes, or if it is more expensive to operate fossil fuel plants and refineries.

Cut emissions of natural gases, especially methane and carbon dioxide, starting early by reducing fossil fuel emissions. Most carbon dioxide is captured and stored in the oceans, which tend to hold the greatest amount.

Implement a range of emission reduction schemes and technologies that will enable emission reductions to be achieved, including energy efficiency, waste heat recovery and water storage.

Implement an industrial transformation to cut GHG emissions from manufacturing and processing and from the construction of new plants and refineries, and from the building of infrastructure to transport petroleum products. As long as fossil fuel infrastructure remains the main source of GHG emissions after 2020, GHG emissions can't decline rapidly.

The IPCC report predicts that climate change will lead to a substantial down-side to energy markets and economic activity throughout the world; we need to re-invest in green technologies instead of relying on our old fossil-based industrial base.

 The policies discussed in this paper will accelerate climate action, by improving global carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that enables us to sequester carbon dioxide in the form of CO2. Policies related to mitigation are a last resort and will, among other things: (a) reduce emissions and cost, with the main focus being on reducing CO2 and GHGs; (b) allow CCS to start to take its own contribution to climate mitigation and reduce pollution, and (c) allow mitigation mechanisms to work through different stages in the industrial era from the early 1990s to present.

The main challenges for carbon capture and storage policy in the coming decades include: (a) increasing the amount of carbon trapped in carbon and carbon waste, because more efficient storage of CO2, will help to improve the carbon cycle efficiency of emissions and to reduce the level of CO2 emissions, and because the sequestration of carbon may contribute significantly toward carbon capture and storage's emissions reduction targets; (b) increasing the cost of CCS infrastructure and facilities; (c) making the CCS infrastructure less expensive, such as by encouraging the development of low-carbon electricity generation; and (d) increasing the efficiency of the CCS processes, as well as developing the infrastructure necessary and increasing capital costs.

Climate change is  a complex field, with numerous contributing factors to its complex picture. The IPCC makes several recommendations for future action – to tackle some of the most significant issues of human-induced climate change, including adaptation, the transition from fossil fuels, mitigation, and sustainable energy.
Although a number of experts have concluded the world's temperature is already on track for catastrophic climate change, these results are not binding for policy makers or other stakeholders in our society.
To improve climate response, the international community must take action fast and to reduce its greenhouse gas and other climate pollution and carbon emissions.
As we approach the 2015 Paris climate change summit at the end of 2015, it is important to establish clear goals for implementation.
Global emission reductions must be high, and are necessary for averting the worst impacts of climate change on everyone, human and non‐human, in each country, regardless of their level of income.
We must also establish global climate partnerships to accelerate mitigation of our climate challenges.
We must ensure we use all options required to reduce GHG emissions, including those which may lower the overall effect, such as reducing CO2 emissions below their historical trends.
In the coming decades, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by developing advanced clean technologies, including bioenergy, microgrids, solar power, carbon capture and storage and natural gas.
