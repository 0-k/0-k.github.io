# Contact

The easiest way to contact me is via email (I will respond): hi@martinklein.co

Alternatively, if you would like to connect with me professionally, you can find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-klein-{:target="blank"}. I am always looking to expand my network and connect with other professionals in the fields of energy, forecasting, data science, and everything else.

If you are interested in my coding projects, you can also find me on GitHub: https://github.com/0-k{:target="blank"}. I am currently working on several projects related to energy forecasting and visualization. I am always open to collaboration and feedback.

I look forward to connecting with you!"
